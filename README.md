# Airport Contagion

Repository for class project on simulating COVID-19 with an airport representation of the United States in an attempt to simulate disease spread in the United States.

Although there is a paper available, most of the work and best explanations are found under the "Disease_Simulation_With_Airport-Cities_In_USA" Jupyter Notebook. I have exported it to a pdf for anyone to see the work, but I would encourage anyone to look into the notebook and mess around with the code a little bit.

Thank you for your time.
